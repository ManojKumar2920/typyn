# Examples & Guides

These guides show Typyn in action—real-world scenarios with copy-paste code. They're designed for quick wins: start simple, build up, and handle edge cases gracefully.

Each guide includes:
- **Full Code**: Ready-to-run snippets (Node or React).
- **Outputs**: What to expect on success/failure.
- **Tips**: DX hacks like error aggregation or testing.
- **Extensions**: Ways to customize.

## Quick Links
- [Form Validation](/examples/form-validation) – UI forms with safe parsing.
- [API Schemas](/examples/api-schemas) – Server-side request validation.
- [Error Handling](/examples/error-handling) – Custom errors and aggregation.

**Pro Tip**: Use `.safe()` for interactive UIs (no crashes); `.parse()` for trusted backends (faster).
